## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0 or later
- A Whop account with a company

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Your app will be available at the URL provided during setup.

## Database Setup

### SQLite

If you selected SQLite, your database is ready to use. A `sqlite.db` file will be created automatically in your project root on first run.

The database client is available at `src/db/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { db } from './db'
import { tasks } from './db/schema'

// Example query
const allTasks = await db.select().from(tasks)
```

### Supabase

If you selected Supabase, follow these steps to complete the setup:

#### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization and set a database password
4. Wait for the project to be created

#### 2. Get Your Credentials

**API Credentials** (Project Settings > API):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your anon/public key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your service role key (keep this secret!)

**Database Connection** (Project Settings > Database):
- Scroll to "Connection String"
- Select "URI" tab
- Copy the connection string
- Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password
- Set this as `DATABASE_URL`

#### 3. Update Your .env File

Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file with the credentials from step 2.

#### 4. Push Your Schema

Run this command to create the initial database schema:

```bash
bun db:push
```

#### 5. Use the Database

You now have two clients available:

**Drizzle Client** (type-safe queries):
```typescript
import { db } from './db'
import { tasks } from './db/schema'

const allTasks = await db.select().from(tasks)
```

**Supabase Client** (auth, storage, realtime):
```typescript
import { supabase } from './db'

// Authentication
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
})

// Storage
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('bucket')
  .upload('file.png', file)

// Realtime
const channel = supabase.channel('room-1')
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'test' }, (payload) => {
    console.log(payload)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

## Available Scripts

## Whop Integration

### Client-Side SDK

Use the Whop context in your React components:

```typescript
'use client'
import { useWhop } from '@/components/whop-context'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const whop = useWhop()
  
  // Access user data
  const user = whop.user
  
  // Make API calls
  const data = await whop.GET('/api/v5/me')
  
  return <div>Hello {user?.username}</div>
}
```

### Server-Side SDK

Use the Whop client in API routes and server components:

```typescript
import { whop } from '@/lib/whop'

// In API route or server component
const user = await whop.me()
```

## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file contains these variables:

- `WHOP_API_KEY` - Your app's API key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID` - Your app's ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID` - Agent user ID for testing
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID` - Your company ID
- `ONE_TIME_PURCHASE_ACCESS_PASS_PLAN_ID` - Test one-time payment plan
- `ONE_TIME_PURCHASE_ACCESS_PASS_ID` - Test one-time payment access pass
